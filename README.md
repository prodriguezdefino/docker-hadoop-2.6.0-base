# Docker Hadoop (v2.6.0) Base Image

A Hadoop base image container for Docker, runs on Ubuntu Trusty Tahr. 

There are some CSV files included (historical baseball statistics) that can be used for testing the installation. 

This image is heavily based on the work made in sequenceiq/docker-hadoop and amplab/docker-scripts repositories (thanks!).
